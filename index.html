 Haarlem is one of the medium-sized cities in the Randstad.
 The municipality of Haarlem includes the city of Haarlem and the western part of the village of Spaarndam.
 Haarlem has 161,265 inhabitants, making it the largest city in North Holland after Amsterdam and the twelfth largest municipality in the Netherlands.
 The metropolitan agglomeration of Haarlem (Haarlem, Heemstede, Bloemendaal and Zandvoort) has approximately 230,000 inhabitants, and the city region of Haarlem (Zuid-Kennemerland and IJmond) more than 430,000 habitants. 
 Haarlem is mentioned for the first time in a document from the 10th century. In 1245 it received city rights from Willem II of Holland. By the end of the Middle Ages, Haarlem had become one of the most important cities in Holland. 
 In the Early Modern Period, the city developed industrially as a textile city and culturally as a painter's city.

    <header><h2>Haarlem Noord</h2></header>
<article id="secondcp">
<p>Haarlem-Noord is a city district of the Dutch municipality of Haarlem with more than 56,000 habitants.
        Until 1927, the area was for the most part part of the former municipality of Schoten.
        The area just north of Haarlem station had already been annexed in 1884. 
        Here, the Frans Halsbuurt and Kleverparkbuurt were quickly built. Construction of the Ripperdakazerne was started in 1882.</p>
        <p>After the annexation of Schoten, the former municipality is almost completely built up within 25 years. There are often single-family homes from the 30s, 40s and 50s of the 20th century. 
        The Rijksstraatweg goes in the middle of Haarlem-Noord towards Velsen. Parallel to the Rijksstraatweg is the Cronj√©straat shopping street at the start of the district. 
        To the west, Haarlem-Noord is bounded by the Westelijke Randweg, east by the Vondelweg and Spaarndamseweg.
        The city district has three important bus stops; Julianapark, Minahassastraat and Delftplein / Spaarne Gasthuis.
        There are some important sports facilities in Haarlem-Noord:
        Hockey club Haarlem, the baseball and softball club Sparks Haarlem and baseball club Kinheim are located there. Previously, football club HFC Haarlem also had its stadium.</p> 
        <p>The Pim Mulier Stadium and the partially covered artificial ice rink are located on the western edge of the city district. 
        In the district is also the smallest zoo in the Netherlands: Artisklas Haarlem.
        Haarlem is a fantastic shopping location. 
        The inner city is reserved for pedestrians and the streets are lined with fashion, jewellery, and antiques shops, as well as exclusive boutiques, international retail chains, and specialty shops.
        Haarlem is at the center of the Dutch flower-growing district. 
        Close to the famous Keukenhof gardens and flower fields of Lisse and Hillegom, the city is a great base for visitors to the Netherlands to see the tulips in full bloom.
        Only 15 minutes by train from Amsterdam, Haarlem is also an excellent place to stay for visitors to other Dutch cities in north and south Holland. It is also very close to historic Leiden, the cheese markets of Alkmaar and an hour from The Hague and vibrant Rotterdam.
        Haarlem makes a great city-break from Amsterdam and other European capitals.</p>
